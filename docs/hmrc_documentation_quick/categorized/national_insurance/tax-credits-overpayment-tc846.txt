Tell HMRC if you’ve received too much tax credits and do not think you should have to pay it back because you met your responsibilities and they did not meet theirs.
You must be able to show that HMRC made a mistake, or gave you incorrect advice, and it was reasonable for you to think your payments were right.

before filling in the form to make sure you can dispute your tax credit overpayment.
You’ll need the following information to fill in the form:
why you’re disputing the overpayment
your National Insurance number (you can find this on your payslip, P60 or tax return)
your partner’s National Insurance number, if the overpayment was made on a joint claim
You should also include details of when you contacted us, and what happened if you told HMRC:
your personal circumstances on your award notice were wrong or incomplete
your payments did not match your award notice
Phone the
Tax Credit Payment Helpline
if you need more time to pay a Tax Credit overpayment.
Applying online
To tell HMRC online, you need a Government Gateway user ID and password.
If you do not have a user ID, you can create one when you tell us.
If you use the online form, you’ll get a reference number that you can use to track the progress of your form.
Applying by post
You’ll need to fill in the form fully before you can print and post it. You cannot save a partly completed form so you should gather all your information together before you start.

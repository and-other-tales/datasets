Email HMRC about reclaiming VAT paid in the UK if your business is based overseas:
newcastle.oru@hmrc.gov.uk
HMRC will only correspond with you by email where you have given us permission to do so.
Email agreement
When we receive your application for VAT refunds, we will send you a copy of the ‘email disclaimer’. Once you’ve read this and accepted the contents, this agreement will apply to all future correspondence on that enquiry.
For a new enquiry or if a period of 12 months or more has elapsed since the last email was sent, we will issue a further ‘email disclaimer’ and ask for email agreement again.
Agents
You must provide a letter of authority from your client agreeing that you may act on their behalf. This is in addition to the email agreement, which must be accepted by both you and your client.
To protect your data, there are certain confidential items which HMRC is prevented from providing by email. If we need to contact you about anything confidential this will continue to be done by phone or post. Please refer to guidance on
phishing emails
for information on how to avoid and report suspicious emails.
